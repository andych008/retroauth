* Storing multiple credentials in the AuthenticationActivity
* Adding some sequence diagrams for a better understanding
* Bugfixes:

## 1.0.2 (2015-08-19)

* Dependency updates:
  * rxjava 1.0.14
  * appcompat 23.0.0
* Introducing RequestStrategies
  * RequestStrategy
    * The most basic one, just executes the request without retrying
  * RetryAndInvalidateStrategy: based on RequestStrategy
    * Retries the request if it returns with 401 and invalidates the token, which was (obviously) not valid anymore
  * LockingStrategy: based on RetryAndInvalidateStrategy
    * only one request (of a tokentype) is executed at once. this is to prevent multiple login screens.

## 1.0.1 (2015-07-28)

* Bugfix
  * When multiple authenticated requests were called at the same time, and the provided token was invalid at this time, multiple 401's were returned and multiple login activities were opened.
    * when you do multiple authenticated requests, there will be only one executed at one time. This is to avoid multiple 401's and multiple activities to open.
    * when a request has to wait for another one, it'll be executed as soon as the previous one returns.
